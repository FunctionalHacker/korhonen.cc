I like PGP and I secure everything I can with it. If you would like to
send me encrypted files, emails or anything of that sort, you came to
the right page. Next up is my public key in different formats.

== Fingerprint
`1EFC4DBB079407113A761DF7C514037F1EFF4FA6`

This is my key fingerprint and it can be found around the various
keyservers on the internet but since the demise of SKS keyservers,
I have not really bothered with keyservers so see below for the full key.

== ASCII Armor

== OpenKeychain
The following QR code should be importable in the Android app
OpenKeyChain but this relys on keyservers so your results may vary.
